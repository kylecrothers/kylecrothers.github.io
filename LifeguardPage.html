    	<center><h1><b><u>This page is about my career as an Ocean Rescue Lifeguard</u></b></h1></center>
    	<h2> From 2016 to 2019 during the months from June to September, I have been employed in my home town as an Ocean Rescue Lifeguard. I have worked at a few different jobs since I've started working and nothing compares to lifeguarding. Some of my best memories are from that job. I grew up on Wells Beach and it only made sense for me to work there. I learned how to swim on that beach, I learned how to surf on that beach. A good 90% of my summers are spent either in the surf or on a lifeguard stand. I have learned so many life skills lifeguarding that I'll take with me for the rest of my life. This past year I was an officer on the squad, so that means I ran the beach. However, like all things, my career as a Wells Ocean Rescue Lifeguard has come to an end. This next summer I am getting an internship in Portland Maine. As much as i want to go back for a fifth season lifeguarding, I need this internship in order to look towards the future.</h2>
